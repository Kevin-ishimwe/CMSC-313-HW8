## PURPOSE OF SOFTWARE
The C and C++ code implement matrix library operations. The goal of the code is to see the differences between the procedural programming approach (C) and the OOP (C++).

## FILES
- **Matrix.c**: C implementation of matrix operations (functional Programming).
- **Matrix.cpp**: C++ implementation of matrix operations (OOP).

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
To build and compile the files, use `gcc` for C and `g++` for C++.

For **Matrix.c**, run :
```bash
sh c.sh
```
For **Matrix.cpp**, run :
```bash
sh c++.sh
```
The commands will compile the code and generate assembly code files in the `x86` folder (`.s` files).

## TESTING METHODOLOGY

The `main` function is used to test the implementation of matrix operations in both C and C++. The tests ensure that the matrix operations work as expected in both versions.
